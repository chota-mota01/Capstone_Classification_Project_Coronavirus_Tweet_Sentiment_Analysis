# Problem Statement

The project entails the development of a classification model aimed at predicting the sentiment expressed in COVID-19-related tweets. The dataset comprises tweets sourced from Twitter, which have undergone manual sentiment tagging. To ensure privacy protection, both names and usernames have been anonymized through encoding.

The primary objective is to leverage machine learning techniques to accurately classify the sentiment conveyed in COVID-19 tweets. By building and deploying a robust classification model, we aim to gain insights into public sentiment surrounding the pandemic, enabling organizations to better understand public perception, sentiment trends, and potential areas of concern or positivity. Through this analysis, we seek to contribute to a deeper understanding of the public discourse surrounding COVID-19 on social media platforms.
